  <h1>Govt. Schemes</h1>
  
 <h3> 1. Soil Health Card Scheme</h3>
 <p>
Launched in 2015, the scheme has been introduced to assist State Governments to issue Soil Health Cards to all farmers in the country.  The Soil Health Cards provide information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility. 
</p>

<h3>2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)</h3>
<p>
PMFBY is an actuarial premium based scheme under which farmer has to pay maximum premium of 2% for Kharif, 1.5% for Rabi food & oilseed crops and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops and remaining part of the actuarial/bidded premium is shared equally by the Centre and State Government.  One of the objectives of the scheme is to facilitate prompt claims settlement. The claims must be settled within two months of harvest subject to timely provision of both yield data and share of premium subsidy by the State Government.
</p>

<h3>3. Neem Coated Urea (NCU)</h3>
<p>
This scheme is initiated to regulate use of urea, enhance availability of nitrogen to the crop and reduce cost of fertilizer application.  NCU slows down the release of fertilizer and makes it available to the crop in an effective manner. The entire quantity of domestically manufactured and imported urea is now neem coated.  It reduces the cost of cultivation and improves soil health management. 
</p>
<h3>
4. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)</h3>
<p>
It was launched on 1st July, 2015 with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’ for providing end-to end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network and farm level applications. 

PMKSY not only focuses on creating sources for assured irrigation, but also creating protective irrigation by harnessing rain water at micro level through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal Sinchan’.  

Micro irrigation is to be popularised to ensure ‘Per drop-More crop’. PMKSY adopts State level planning and projectised execution that allows States to draw up their own irrigation development based on District Irrigation Plans and State Irrigation Plans.

5. Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)</h3>
<p>
It is implemented with a view to promote organic farming in the country. To improve soil health and organic matter content and increase net income of the farmer so as to realise premium prices.  Under this scheme, an area of 5 lakh acre is targeted to be covered though 10,000 clusters of 50 acre each, from the year 2015-16 to 2017-18.

  <h1>Loan Policies</h1>

 <h3> 1.National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)</h3>
 <p>
In India, all premier banking and financial organisations, at all levels, offer a great deal of financial help to farmers. However, this trend of boosting the rural economy and agriculture through financial credit was started by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) back in the early 1980s. When it comes to credit in the field of agriculture, all other banks throughout the country fall under the purview of the NABARD.

This financial institution is working in conjunction with the Government of India to boost agriculture sector. It is credited with several innovative schemes that have immensely aided the farmers throughout the country. The most notable scheme launched by the NABARD is the Kisan Credit Card (KCC).
</p>
<h3>
2.Kisan Credit Card Scheme</h3>
<p>
The Kisan Credit Card is a scheme launched by the Indian banks back in 1998, as a way to fulfill the financial necessities of the agricultural sector. This is done by giving monetary support to farmers, which in turn comes with various features and benefits. The quantum of the loan depends on several factors like cost of cultivation, farm maintenance cost, et cetera.

This has been particularly beneficial for those farmers who are not aware of the banking practices. Moreover, it is meant to protect farmers from harsh and informal creditors, which may land them in a massive debt.

The farmers can use the KCC card to withdraw funds for the purpose of crop production and domestic requirements.

Applying for the KCC is a simple, hassle-free process that requires minimal documentation. It also offers crop insurance coverage, along with subsidies on interest payments. Speaking of interest, farmers applying for loans under the KCC scheme can borrow funds at 7 percent per annum, for amounts up to Rs. 3 lakh.

The Kisan Credit Card is linked to the farmer’s savings account and all the transactions are done under a single account. Additionally, any credit balance in the KCC account earns interest. All farmers can apply for a KCC and if you are looking to apply for one, then visit your nearest bank for more information.

<h3>
3.Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme: </h3>
<p>This scheme is meant to promote the dairy sector, specifically by setting up modernized dairy farms, promoting calf rearing, provide infrastructure, upgrading logistical operations to improve the product on a commercial scale, and generate self-employment.
</p>
<h3>
4.Rural Godowns:</h3>
<p>The main objective of this scheme is to help farmers throughout the country by providing them with godowns. This will, in turn, improve their holding capacity drastically and as a result, they will be able to sell their produce at fair rates, rather than selling them under distress. In addition to this, with a nationalised warehouse system in place, the marketing of agricultural produce becomes simpler.
</p>
<h3>5.Loan Against Warehouse Receipts:</h3>
<p>
Warehouse receipt financing serves as a foolproof way to prevent distress sales. When a farmer needs funds, post-harvest, all he has to do is store his produce in a Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) accredited warehouse, which in turn issues him a receipt. This warehouse receipt mentions important details like quality and quantity of the produce, and can be used to get credit from banks, up to 70 percent of the collateral value.
</p>
<h3>6.Solar Schemes:</h3>
<p>These schemes were implemented in order to reduce dependence on grid power by promoting the use of solar equipment. The idea here is to replace diesel pumps with solar ones, considering that they have low operating costs and are environment-friendly.

  <h1>Health Policies</h1>
 <h3>1.Term Life Insurance</h3>
  <p>
Term life is a type of life insurance policy where premiums remain level for a specified period of time —generally for 10, 20 or 30 years. After the end of the level premium period, premiums will generally increase. Coverage continues as long as the premiums are paid. Perhaps this is an option you may want to consider when you’re on a more limited budget and will have significant expenses over a shorter period of time.

You can often pay a lower premium when you select a shorter term — say, 10 years instead of 20. But since premiums are based on risk of death, once you are outside of the level premium period, a term life policy generally gets more expensive as you grow older.
</p>
<h3>
2.Whole Life Insurance </h3>
<p>
Whole life is permanent insurance — you’re insured throughout your lifetime, or until the policy matures, as long as you continue to pay your premiums per terms of the contract. And those premiums will stay level as long as the policy remains in force. Over time, permanent insurance typically accumulates a cash value that can be accessed1 for a variety of purposes while you’re still alive.
</p>
<h3>3.Universal Life Insurance </h3>
<p>
Like whole life, universal life is permanent insurance that may also accumulate a cash value. It offers more flexibility, though. You can tailor a policy to meet changing priorities with flexible premiums2 and face amounts. Universal life also offers you more control over how quickly your cash value grows.
